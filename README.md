## 🌴 Honolulu Climate Analysis

Planning a vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii? ☀️ This project helps analyze historical climate data—including temperature and precipitation trends—to better understand weather patterns and optimize your trip planning. Using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we explore and visualize data from an existing SQLite climate database.

## 📌 Project Overview

This climate analysis project involves:

Reflecting an existing SQLite climate database into a Python model using SQLAlchemy.

Performing data exploration and analysis on temperature and precipitation trends.

Visualizing key metrics to aid in making informed travel decisions.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

Python 3.10, Jupyter Notebook, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLite

## 🔍Steps to Complete the Project

1. Reflect the Existing Database

Use SQLAlchemy to connect to the existing SQLite database.

Reflect the database schema into a new model.

2. Query the Database

Retrieve precipitation data for the last 12 months.

Analyze temperature observations from key weather stations.

3. Perform Data Analysis

Calculate summary statistics for precipitation and temperature.

Identify seasonal weather trends.

4. Visualize the Data

Generate a line plot using Matplotlib to visualize daily precipitation levels over the last year of available data.

Create a histogram to show the distribution of temperature observations.

## 📊Result Analysis

The most commonly recorded temperatures ranged between 73°F and 78°F, indicating a consistently warm climate ideal for vacationing.

While most days experienced low rainfall (under 1 inch), there were several significant spikes, with some days reaching over 6 inches (max 6.7). These occasional heavy rain events indicate variability in precipitation despite the overall trend of mild daily rainfall with 75% chance with 0.13 inch.
